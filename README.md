### Beat The Computer game

Beat The Computer is an interactive game where players must try and click on as many matching colours as they can to win. 
The colours are randomly generated. Sometimes there will be a match and other times there won't.
Players have 15 seconds to try and get 20 points. If the black colour is clicked the speed of colours will change on the board quicker.


For the animated background, I used Canvas and object oriented programming to create stars that float around the screen. 
This background is interactive and the stars will brighten with mouse interaction.
